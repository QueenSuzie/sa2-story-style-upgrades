## Story Style Upgrades
This mod automatically handles upgrades for you to set your upgrades at the start of each stage to what they would be during the start of a new story mode.
For example, if you enter Green Forest, the only upgrade you will have is the light dash. Regardless of what upgrades you have in your save file,
you will have the light dash, and you won't have anything else. This is to help with Story Style practice for speedruns.

## Installation
This mod is compatible with the [SA2 Mod Manager.](https://github.com/X-Hax/SA-Mod-Manager) Download the latest release and place
the folder inside the 7z archive within your SA2 mods folder. Then enable the mod in your mod manager.

## Configuration

The mod also has several configuration options to customize the behavior to your liking for certain aspects of practice. Each setting works as follows:

### Include Current Level Upgrade

This makes it so that at the start of a stage which includes a collected upgrade, you will not need to collect it and you will have it.
Example: Metal Harbor is where you collect the Light Shoes for using light dash as Sonic. If this setting is enabled, you will start the
stage with light dash already and you can skip the upgrade. Otherwise, you will have to collect the upgrade as normal.

### Include Current Hunting Level Upgrade

This is a similar setting to "Include Current Level Upgrade" but for hunting characters only. When enabled, for hunting characters only
your upgrades will be collected as described above. However, if "Include Current Level Upgrade" is enabled, this setting will do nothing
whether enabled or disabled.

### Disable All Shadow Upgrades

Normally, Shadow never collects an upgrade during a regular NG Dark Story run. Enable this setting to ensure Shadow never has any upgrades in any stage.
Otherwise, Shadow's upgrades will be set as they would be during a normal casual playthrough.

### Disable Sonic Flame Ring

Similar to the above, the flame ring is typically not collected. Enable this setting to disable the Flame Ring in Final Rush,
Shadow 2 and Canon's Core. Realistically, this setting doesn't affect practice much.

### Enable Upgrade Restore on Restart

This setting makes it possible to reset your upgrades to what they were at the start of the stage by just restarting the level.
For example, when you start Metal Harbor assuming you have "Include Current Level Upgrade" turned off, you will not have the light dash.
After you collect the light dash, if you restart you will still have the light dash. So you would have to exit and then return to the
stage to collect the light dash again. With this enabled, you can hold the "Upgrade Reset Button" while selecting yes on a normal
level restart and you will no longer have the light dash so that you can practice collecting it again. If you still have it, it probably means you
held the "Upgrade Reset Button" too late so make sure you are holding it before and throughout your A press on the restart confirmation dialog.

### Upgrade Reset Button

This is the button you need to be holding for the upgrade restore on restart. Currently although Z is an option, I don't think it actually works.
Maybe it works on GameCube controllers but I don't have one for testing this. I suggest you stick with the other options, and personally find left
trigger to be the most convenient.
